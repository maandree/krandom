NAME
	krandom - Keccak-based userspace pseudorandom number generator

SYNOPSIS
	krandom [-C capacity] [-N output-size] [-R rate] [-S state-size] [-W word-size] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
	krandom create a Keccak sponge with a random state
	and continually squeezes it to generate pseudorandom
	binary data.

	Like yes(1), krandom will automatically pause soon
	after the other end of the standard output pipe stops
	reading and will terminate with no process reading
	at the other end of the standard output pipe anymore.

	With the default parameters, krandom is about twice
	as fast as Linux's /dev/urandom. And it's tunable!

OPTIONS
	The following options are supported:

	-C capacity
		Select Keccak capacity.

	-R rate
		Select Keccak rate.

	-N output-size
		Select Keccak output size. This is the size
		of a squeezed block, the total output is
		unlimited.

	-S state-size
		Select Keccak state size.

	-W state-size
		Select Keccak word size.

	-v
		Print extra information.

NOTES
	krandom is a terrible entropy-generator. Good ways
	to generate entropy include: typing randomly in the
	terminal, moving the rat pointer around erratically,
	running ping, listening to music, and watching videos.
