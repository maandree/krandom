Keccak-based userspace pseudorandom number generator.

With the default parameters, krandom is about twice
as fast as Linux's /dev/urandom. And it's tunable!


Can krandom be used as an entropy-generator?

  Basically, no. The only less effective way
  to generate entropy is to print /dev/urandom.
  Good ways to generate entropy include:
    Typing randomly in the terminal
    Moving the rat pointer around erratically
    Run ping
    Listen to music
    Watch videos
    Run ponysay (surprisingly effective)
